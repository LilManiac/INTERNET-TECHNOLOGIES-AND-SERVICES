        <p><blockquote>
            <span style="background-color:silver;">The search for life beyond Earth is really just getting started, but science <br/>
            has an encouraging early answer: there are plenty of planets in the galaxy, <br/>
            many with similarities to our own. But what we donâ€™t know fills volumes.</span><br/>
            <br/>
            Observations from the ground and from space have confirmed thousands <br/>
            of planets beyond our solar system. Our galaxy likely holds trillions. <br/>
            But so far, we have no evidence of life beyond Earth. <br/>
            <em>Is life in the cosmos easily begun, and commonplace? Or is it incredibly rare? </em> <br/><br/>

            <h1 span style="color:green">More questions than answers...</h1> 

            In the thousands of years humanity has been contemplating the cosmos, <br/>
            we are the first people to know one thing for sure: The stars beyond <br/>
            our Sun are teeming with planets. They come in many varieties, and a good <br/>
            chunk of them are around the size of Earth. Like most scientific questions, <br/>
            though, getting an answer to this one just breeds more questions: <em>Which, <br/>
            if any,of these exoplanets harbors some form of life? How quickly does life  <br/>
            get its start? And how long does it last?</em> <br/>
